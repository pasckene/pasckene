### **Detection Engineer | Threat Hunter | Adversary Behavior Analyst**

> *"I don’t chase alerts; I engineer the logic that traps adversaries."*

I specialize in **Detection Engineering** and **Proactive Threat Hunting**. My focus is on turning raw telemetry into high-fidelity behavioral detections by mapping attacker TTPs to the **MITRE ATT&CK®** framework. I build resilient security systems that prioritize signal over noise.

### 🎯 Core Expertise

* **Detection Engineering:** Rule development (Sigma/YARA), tuning, and false-positive reduction.
* **Threat Hunting:** Behavioral analytics, endpoint/network telemetry, and "Impossible Travel" logic.
* **Adversary Emulation:** Simulating TTPs to validate detection coverage and fill visibility gaps.
* **Log Analysis:** Deep-dive auditing of Sysmon, Windows Events, Proxy, and Auth logs.

### 🏆 Featured Labs & Projects

#### **🔥 Adversary Simulation & Detection Lab**

A full-scale Blue Team environment built to emulate real-world attack chains and engineer detection logic.

* **Simulated:** Credential Access, Lateral Movement (Pass-the-Hash), and Persistence.
* **Tech:** Active Directory, Sysmon, Splunk, and Kali Linux.
* **Outcome:** 15+ custom behavioral rules mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK** with full incident playbooks.
A structured repository of detection rules and tuning strategies designed for enterprise scale.
* **Includes:** Sigma/YARA rules, coverage gap analysis, and automated log parsing scripts.
* **Focus:** Reducing alert fatigue by shifting from IOC-based to Behavioral-based detection.

### 🧬 Operational Philosophy

1. **Understand** the adversary's objective.
2. **Analyze** the telemetry "breadbrumbs" they leave behind.
3. **Engineer** high-fidelity detections.
4. **Validate** through simulation.
5. **Refine** to eliminate noise.
