## 🚀 Professional Profile

Cybersecurity professional specializing in **Threat Hunting, Detection Engineering, and Adversary Behavior Analysis**.

I design and engineer high-fidelity detection strategies based on attacker TTPs, leveraging deep log analysis, behavioral analytics, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping to uncover stealthy threats before they escalate.

Focused on building resilient detection systems that prioritize signal over noise.

## 🎯 Core Competencies

* 🔎 Advanced Threat Hunting
* 🧠 Detection Engineering & Rule Development
* 📊 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping & Coverage Analysis
* 🚨 Incident Triage & Escalation Workflow
* 📈 Alert Tuning & False Positive Reduction
* 🧬 Behavioral-Based Detection Strategy

## 🧪 Operational Philosophy

My approach to security is structured and adversary-focused:

1. Understand attacker objectives
2. Analyze TTP chains
3. Map behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK
4. Engineer behavioral detections
5. Validate via simulation
6. Tune for precision
7. Document & operationalize

Detection is engineered — not improvised.
